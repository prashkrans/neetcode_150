/* LC#286. NCG4. Premium Walls and Gates (Neetcode: Islands and Treasure)
LintCode#663 Â· Walls and Gates
https://neetcode.io/problems/islands-and-treasure
Note: This question is similar to is oranges rotten (LC#994)

Approaches:
1. Multi-Source BFS + dist variable + foor loop within the BFS
2. Multi-Source BFS + Update distance of child as 1 + distance of parent

### Approach 1: Multi-Source BFS for Distance Propagation
1. Identify all cells with value 0 (gates) in the grid and add them to a queue. These
act as the starting points for the BFS traversal.
2. Use a queue to perform a multi-source BFS. Each gate propagates its distance to
reachable cells in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
3. Maintain a `dist` variable to track the current distance being propagated. Start
with `dist = 1` and increment it after processing each BFS level.
4. For each cell processed in the BFS:
   a. Check its four neighbors. If a neighbor is within bounds, not a wall (-1), not
a gate (0), and its current value is greater than `dist`, update its value to `dist`.
   b. Add the updated neighbor to the queue for further processing.
5. Continue the BFS until the queue is empty, ensuring that all reachable cells are
updated with the shortest distance to a gate.
6. The algorithm ensures that each cell is processed at most once, resulting in a time
complexity of O(m * n), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.

### Approach 2: Multi-Source BFS + Update distance of child as distance of parent + 1
1. Define a helper function `isValid` to check if a cell is within bounds, not a wall
(-1), and not a gate (0). This ensures that only valid and traversable cells are
processed.
2. Implement a BFS function that starts from a given gate and propagates distances to
all reachable cells. Use a queue to perform the BFS traversal.
3. For each cell processed in the BFS:
   a. Check its four neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is valid and its
current value is greater than the distance from the current cell plus one, update its
value to the new distance.
   b. Add the updated neighbor to the queue for further processing.
4. In the main function `islandsAndTreasure`, iterate over all cells in the grid. For
each gate (cell with value 0), call the BFS function to propagate distances from that
gate.
5. The algorithm ensures that each cell is processed at most once, resulting in a time
complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.

// Method 2. Multisource BFS + Update distance of child as distance of parent + 1
// Running time: O(number of zeroes * BFS) = O(k*n*m)[Incorrect] but O(n*m) as k doesn't matter here 
// Auxiliary space: O(n) due to the BFS queue
// where n = number of rows
// m = number of columns
// k = number of zeroes
// Note: Thus, the actual time complexity is still O(n * m), not O(k * n * m). 
// The number of 0s affects only the starting conditions but does not multiply the complexity.


// Time Complexity: O(n * m)
// - Each cell is processed at most once during the BFS traversal.
// - n = number of rows, m = number of columns.

// Space Complexity: O(n * m)
// - The BFS queue can hold up to all cells in the grid in the worst case.
