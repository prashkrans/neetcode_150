/* LC#42. NCTP5. & NCST8. Trapping Rain Water
This is an easier variant of the problem LC#84 Largest Area in Histogram
[#IMP] This is slightly different from LC#84 as we add water at each index instead of a range i.e. right - left

From the image, we can see that to calculate the amount of water trapped at a position, 
the greater element to the left l and the greater element to the right r of the current position 
are crucial. 
[#IMP] The formula for the trapped water at index i is given by: max(0, min(height[l], height[r]) - height[i])

### Approach 1: Precomputing Left and Right Maximum Bounds using a max height variable
1. The problem is to calculate how much water can be trapped after rain given an array where each element represents the height of a bar.
2. Water above a bar is limited by the shorter of the tallest bars to its left and right.
3. Precompute the maximum height to the left of each bar (`leftMost`) and the maximum height to the right of each bar (`rightMost`).
4. For each bar, calculate the trapped water as `min(leftMost[i], rightMost[i]) - height[i]`.
5. Accumulate the trapped water for all bars to get the total trapped water.
6. This approach uses three passes:
   a. First pass: Compute the `leftMost` array.
   b. Second pass: Compute the `rightMost` array.
   c. Third pass: Calculate the trapped water for each bar.
7. The solution has O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity due to the use of the `leftMost` and `rightMost` arrays.

// 1. Preprocessing Left and Right Maximum Bounds using a max height variable
// Time Complexity: O(3n) ~ O(n), where n = number of bars in the height array | 0ms beats 100%
// Space Complexity: O(n), for storing leftBound, rightBound

// Time Complexity: O(n)
// - The first loop calculates the leftMost array in O(n).
// - The second loop calculates the rightMost array in O(n).
// - The third loop calculates the trapped water for each bar in O(n).
// - Overall complexity is O(3n) â‰ˆ O(n), where n is the number of bars in the height array.

// Space Complexity: O(n)
// - Space is used for the `leftMost` and `rightMost` arrays, each of size n.

/* Approach: Two Pointer Optimization with Constant Space
1. The problem is to calculate how much water can be trapped after rain given an array where each element represents the height of a bar.
2. Water above a bar is limited by the shorter of the tallest bars to its left and right. Instead of precomputing bounds, we optimize using two pointers.
3. Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (l) and one at the end (r) of the height array. Also initialize leftMax and rightMax to the heights at those positions.
4. At each step, compare leftMax and rightMax. Move the pointer pointing to the side with the smaller maximum height inward, as this side limits water.
5. If moving left pointer, update leftMax and calculate water at the new left position as leftMax - height[l]. Accumulate to total.
6. Similarly, if moving right pointer, update rightMax and calculate water at the new right position as rightMax - height[r].
7. Continue until the two pointers meet. This ensures all bars are processed in linear time without needing extra space for bounds.
8. This is the most space-efficient approach while maintaining O(n) time,  making it optimal for the given problem.
