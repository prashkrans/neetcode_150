/* LC#42. NCTP5. & NCST8. Trapping Rain Water
This is an easier variant of the problem LC#84 Largest Rectangle in Histogram

From the image, we can see that to calculate the amount of water trapped at a position, 
the greater element to the left l and the greater element to the right r of the current position 
are crucial. 
[#IMP] The formula for the trapped water at index i is given by: min(height[l], height[r]) - height[i].

I. Approach: Preprocessing Left and Right Maximum Bounds Using Stack
1. The goal is to compute how much water can be trapped between the bars after
   raining, where water trapped at each index depends on the minimum of the
   maximum heights to its left and right.
2. We first build a leftBound array using a stack. For each bar, we compute the
   maximum height seen to the left. We compare the previous barâ€™s height and the
   current max from stack to update the left bound.
3. Similarly, we build the rightBound array by iterating from the right. For each
   bar, we compute the max height seen to its right using the next bar and the
   top of the stack.
4. At the end of each of these loops, we debug print the left and right bounds
   to verify the preprocessing.
5. After having both bounds, we loop through each index and compute the water
   trapped at that index as max(0, min(leftBound, rightBound) - height[i]).
6. This ensures no negative water values are added, and we only accumulate where
   a container can actually hold water.
7. The final result is returned after summing the trapped water at all indices.
8. Overall complexity is linear due to double-pass preprocessing and one more
   pass for summation, making the approach efficient.

/* Approach: Two Pointer Optimization with Constant Space
1. The problem is to calculate how much water can be trapped after rain given an array where each element represents the height of a bar.
2. Water above a bar is limited by the shorter of the tallest bars to its left and right. Instead of precomputing bounds, we optimize using two pointers.
3. Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (l) and one at the end (r) of the height array. Also initialize leftMax and rightMax to the heights at those positions.
4. At each step, compare leftMax and rightMax. Move the pointer pointing to the side with the smaller maximum height inward, as this side limits water.
5. If moving left pointer, update leftMax and calculate water at the new left position as leftMax - height[l]. Accumulate to total.
6. Similarly, if moving right pointer, update rightMax and calculate water at the new right position as rightMax - height[r].
7. Continue until the two pointers meet. This ensures all bars are processed in linear time without needing extra space for bounds.
8. This is the most space-efficient approach while maintaining O(n) time,  making it optimal for the given problem.
