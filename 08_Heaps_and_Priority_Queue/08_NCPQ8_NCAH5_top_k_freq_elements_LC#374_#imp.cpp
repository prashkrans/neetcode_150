/* LC#347. NCAH6. NCPQ8. Top K Frequent Elements

### Approach 2: Using a Max Heap (Priority Queue) along with Frequency Counting
1. Create a frequency map (unordered_map) to count how many times each number appears
in the input array. This allows O(1) lookups for each element.
2. Use a max heap (priority queue) to store elements by their frequency. Each entry in
the heap is a pair of (frequency, element).
3. Push all elements from the frequency map into the heap. The heap automatically
orders elements by their frequency in descending order.
4. Extract the top k elements from the heap:
   a. For each of the k iterations, retrieve the element with the highest frequency
from the top of the heap.
   b. Add the element to the result vector and remove it from the heap.
5. Return the result vector containing the k most frequent elements.
6. The algorithm ensures efficient insertion and extraction using the heap, resulting
in a time complexity of O(n + m log m), where n is the size of the input array and m is
the number of unique elements.

### Approach 3: Using a Min Heap (Priority Queue) along with Frequency Counting
1. Create a frequency map (unordered_map) to count how many times each number appears
in the input array. This allows O(1) lookups for each element.
2. Use a min heap (priority queue) to store elements by their frequency. Each entry in
the heap is a pair of (frequency, element).
3. Push elements from the frequency map into the heap:
   a. If the heap size exceeds k, remove the element with the smallest frequency from
the heap. This ensures that the heap always contains the k most frequent elements.
4. Extract all elements from the heap:
   a. Add each element in the heap to the result vector. The heap contains the k most
frequent elements in ascending order of frequency.
5. Return the result vector containing the k most frequent elements.
6. The algorithm ensures efficient insertion and extraction using the heap, resulting
in a time complexity of O(n + m log k), where n is the size of the input array and m is
the number of unique elements.

/* Could safely ignore this approach as its not efficient
### Approach 1: Frequency Counting with Manual Selection
1. Create a frequency map (unordered_map) to count how many times each number appears
in the input array, which allows O(1) lookups.
2. The algorithm then performs k iterations to find the k most frequent elements,
selecting one in each iteration.
3. In each iteration, we scan through the entire frequency map to find the
element with the highest frequency that hasn't been selected yet.
4. Once we find the element with maximum frequency, we add it to our
result vector and set its frequency to zero in the map.
5. Setting the frequency to zero ensures we don't select the same element
again in subsequent iterations.
6. This approach uses a greedy method by always selecting the most frequent
element available at each step.
7. The time complexity is dominated by the k iterations through the frequency
map, making it O(n + k*m) where m is the unique element count.
8. While not the most efficient solution (a heap would be better), this
approach is straightforward and handles the problem correctly.
