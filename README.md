## How to Use

Each solution file is named after the problem and includes:
- The **NeetCode** and **LeetCode** problem numbers  
- A step-by-step explanation of the approach  
- Both my custom solution and the optimal solution (where applicable)  
- **Inline comments** on the right side explaining key parts of the code  
- **Time** and **space** complexity analysis  
- Alternative or multiple approaches (where applicable)  
- Only the `Solution` class and the relevant function implementation (no driver code or test cases)  
- All solutions have been tested
